# Tic-Tac-Toe with Smarter AI

This project provides a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe implementation that supports both a legacy random-move bot and a new optimal opponent that plays according to player input.

## Features
- Interactive console UI with input validation.
- Player can choose to play as `X` or `O`.
- Two AI skill levels:
  - Random
  - Optimal:

## How to Play
1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python tictactoe.py
   ```
2. Choose whether you want to be Player 1 (`X`) or Player 2 (`O`).

3. Enter moves as two numbers separated by a space (row and column, both 0-2).

Enjoy exploring the contrast between casual and optimal Tic-Tac-Toe play!*** End Patch
